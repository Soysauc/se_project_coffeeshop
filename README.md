# Practicum Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Web Development program at Practicum. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

My project seemed complete but the '.css' components were not nested within proper BEM file structure. What I learned whilst engaging in this project was to develop clean looking and orderly code using BEM.

What you may expect to find here is an appealing looking website that visually looks as the brief attempts to lay out albeit with some flexibility in the 'Menu' section.
